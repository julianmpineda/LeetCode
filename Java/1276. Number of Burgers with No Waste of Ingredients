/* 
  Initially written with a loop that counts out small burgers,
  then backfills with jumbo burgers. This works, but it's pretty slow.
  It also makes more sense to calculate the bigger burgers first, then
  fill in the smaller ones. Since the loop only really was doing addition,
  which then had to be fixed via math anyway, it was easy to see that
  a pure math solution could work.

/*
  One pointer per array allows us to use a single loop. Loops through
  students array until a match is found, then moves to the next sandwich.
  Modifying the students array "removes" students that have claimed a 
  sandwich and ensures they never match to a second. While loop exits 
  once students has been looped through without a match.

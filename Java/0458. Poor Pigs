/* The coding for this was trivial, it was really the math I had a hard
   time understanding. The hints on LeetCode spell out the solution, but
   don't explain it at all. I googled it and checked a few blogs, primarily
   https://algo.monster/liteproblems/458 and this comment by user NikkiNicholas
   (https://leetcode.com/problems/poor-pigs/solutions/94273/solution-with-detailed-explanation/)
   that really helped me write out my own examples and figure out why
   the proposed math worked.

/*
  Trivial to code, the issue is trying to decipher the math.
  The minute hand makes the full 360 degree rotation in 60 mins,
  so the it moves 1 degree every 6 minutes. The hour hand is a 
  bit more work, but will rotate in 12 hours, or 720 minutes. 
  Each hour is 30 degrees, so each minute is .5 degrees. Also need
  to remember that 12 hour should be to 0.

    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {

        return Math.abs((hour % 12) * 30 + minutes * .5) - (6 * minutes));
    }
}

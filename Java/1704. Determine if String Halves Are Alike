/*
  Tried some versions, this was my initial one and
  ended up being the fastest still, though not by much.
  I also tried hardcoding a giant if or with all ten vowels,
  but for some reason ran 1ms longer. Similarly, the version
  that converted the chars toLowerCase with a smaller if 
  statement also ran slightly longer. Converting the
  entire string toLowerCase ran much longer than any previous 
  attempt.

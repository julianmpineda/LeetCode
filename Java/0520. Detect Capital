  Easy problem, but set my own constraint to do this without looping, 
  and had initially written out multiple if statements. Realized it 
  could be condensed into a single return. Substring from my research
  runs in 0(n) time based on the length of the resulting string, so by 
  assigning it to a variable saves time instead of calling it 3 times.

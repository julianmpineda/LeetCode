/*
  Started with a set instead of array, but the runtime over such a small
  set is greater than an array. Tried a few variations to try to shave off 
  some time. Don't think it mattered in the end more than the inherent 
  randomness of the leetcode IDE. Tried using flags, ints, methods instead 
  of nested loops, continues, breaks, labels, but all averaged the same time 
  over multiple runs. This is the earliest version with an array and one of 
  the more readable ones.
